Fix the code to welcome the Employee

fix.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
 <script src=”script.js”></script>
</body>
</html>
script.js

let login = 'Employee';
let message = (login == 'Employee') ? :
  (login == 'Director') ? 'Greetings' :
  (login == '') ? 'No login' :
  '';
console.log(message);

My code:
In the ternary operator we have to give OR(||) operator between the employee and director comaprison.
script.js

let login = 'Employee';
let message = (login == 'Employee') ||   //Here i give the OR operator in between the employee and the director
  (login == 'Director') ? 'Greetings' :
  (login == '') ? 'No login' :
  '';
console.log(message);
