If you run the below scritpt you will get “Code is Blasted”

Explain Why the Code is blasted and how to diffuse it and get “Diffused”.

fix.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
 <script src=”script.js”></script>
</body>
</html>
script.js

var a = "2" > "12";
//Don't touch below this
if (a) {
  console.log("Code is Blasted")
}
else
{
  console.log("Diffused") 
}

My code:
In js code the numbers 2 and 12 are treated as strings because it is with in the double quotes("").
If we take the double quotes and put the numbers as it is. Then it will diffused.
ANS:
script.js

var a = 2 > 12; //Here it erased the double quotes, now its diffused.
//Don't touch below this
if (a) {
  console.log("Code is Blasted")
}
else
{
  console.log("Diffused") 
}
