GUVI: Zen Class — Part 3: Find the culprits and nail them — debugging javascript

2)Fix the code to Sum of the digits present in the number

Code:

let n = 123;
console.log(add(n));
function add(n)
{
let sum = 10;
for(var i=0;i<n.length;i++){
 sum+=n[i]
 }
 return sum;
}

My sol:
 i)  At first n have to be converted to string and split.
ii)  The variable sum have to be initialized with 0.
iii) And the n[i] have to be casted as number while adding with string.

ANS:
let n = 123;
n=n.toString().split('');  //n have to be converted to string and split.
console.log(add(n));
function add(n)
{
var sum = 0;   //sum have to be initialized with 0.
for(var i=0;i<n.length;i++){
 sum+=Number(n[i])  //n[i] have to be casted as number while adding with string.
 }
 return sum;
}
