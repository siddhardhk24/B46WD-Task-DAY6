6)Fix the code to sum the number in that array

Code:

const num = [10, 20, 30, 40,50,60,70,80,90,100] 
const sum = (a, b) =>
 a + b
const sum = num.reduce(sum)
console.log(sum);

My code:

const num = [10, 20, 30, 40,50,60,70,80,90,100];
var sum = (a, b) =>       //here the sum have to be declare as var.
 a + b;
 sum = num.reduce(sum);    //don't need to redeclare sum
console.log(sum);
