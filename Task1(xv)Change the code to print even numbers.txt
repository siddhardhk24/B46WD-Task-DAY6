script.js

//You are allowed to modify only one character 
for (let num = 2; num <= 20; num += 1) {
  console.log(num)
}

My code:
  In this i have to print the even numbers and i m allowed to make only 
  one change. I changed the updation value in for loop. Thats it.
  
script.js

//You are allowed to modify only one character 
for (let num = 2; num <= 20; num += 2) { // here in updation part i changed the value as 2.
  console.log(num)
}
