Change the code to print all the gifts

fix.html

<!DOCTYPE html>

script.js

let gifts = ["teddy bear", "drone", "doll"];
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log('Wrapped ${'gifts[i]'} and added a bow!');
}

My code:
  Here i have to print the gifts array. I make only two changes instead of ('') i changed (``)tilt symbol
  within the console. And with in the console i erased the ('') for gifts.
  
Ans:
script.js

let gifts = ["teddy bear", "drone", "doll"];
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log(`Wrapped ${gifts[i]} and added a bow!`);//('')=>(``)
  //for gifts[i] i taken the single quotes('').
}
