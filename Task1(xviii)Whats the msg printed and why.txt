Whats the msg printed and why? Guess you answer before running it.

var lemein = “0”;
var lemeout = 0;
var msg = “”;
if (lemein) {
 msg += “hi”;
 }
if (lemeout) {
 msg += ‘Hello’;
}
console.log(msg);

ANS:
i)   Here lemein value is a string, so if we check it in the if condition it will be true.
ii)  Because value 0 is with in the double quotes(""). so it will consider as string.
iii) In lemeout value is 0, so if we check it in the if condition it will be false.
iv)  In boolean value of false is 0, so it will not satisfy the if condition.
