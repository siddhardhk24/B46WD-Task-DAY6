script.js

alert("I'm JavaScript!");
alert('Hello') // this line is not having semicolon
alert(`Wor
 ld`)
alert(3 +
1
+ 2); // this is multiple line code and its working

ANS:
i)alert('Hello') // this line is not having semicolon
ANS:
   In javascript the semicolon is not mandatory. If we end with semicolon, its a proper way to end 
 if not it's not an error in JS.
 
ii)alert(`Wor
 ld`)  // this is multiple line code and its working
 ANS:
   In javascript the tilt symbol is used to give a sentence in multiple lines. So that would not be 
 an error in javascript.
 
iii) alert(3 +
1
+ 2); // this is multiple line code and its working
ANS:
   In this the alert is filled with numbers and operators. If any operators missed in between the 
   numbers then it will be an error. But here for every number the addition operator is placed, so 
   the multiple lines are not a problem in using numbers.
