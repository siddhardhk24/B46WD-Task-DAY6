script.js

//You can change only 2 characters
let i = 3;
while (i) {
  console.log( --i );
}

My code:
 In this change only two characters, were the where the i have to be changed to 
 pre-decrement to post decrement. Thats it.
 
 ANS:
 script.js

//You can change only 2 characters
let i = 3;
while (i) {
  console.log( i-- );// here i changed pre-decrement to post decrement.
}
